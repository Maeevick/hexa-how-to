Examples to illustrate my articles on my newsletter Marevick's Bazaar (https://maeevick.substack.com)

## branch dedicated to the "Hexagonal Architecture: How To nÂ°2": a simple case from scratch

Link to the newsletter's episode: coming soon

We follow the "official" blueprint from Alistair Cockburn in Hexagonal Architecture Explained.

### Step 0: the Setup

For this first case:

- I will use TypeScript on NodeJS 22
- Some NodeJS' flags to strip types and the Native Test Runner

```shell
npm run start
# executes the setup's code and displays "Hello TS in NodeJS!" in the console.

npm run test
# executes the setup's test and displays the passing test results.
```
